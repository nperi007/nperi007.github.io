        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Nola Perifel. I have lived in the United States for 16 years after having moved at 2 years old from my birth place, Paris, France. I was raised in a French household and attended a French-American University which led me to be completely fluent in both English and French. I am now a first-year student at the University of California, Riverside, pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Creative Writing and minoring in Psychology and Dance. I love listening and giving advice so I am starting to feel interested in Psychology as my main career path. <br><br>

        I am interested in obtaining a Masters in Psychology to become a Clinical or Play therapist as I feel like I have a strong connection with kids and want to help them in any way that I can. I also aspire to become a journalist, novelist or screenwriter if I decide to pursue a career in writing because writing is a great passion of mine that I do not want to give up. <br><br>
        I am currently a contributing writer for The Highlander newspaper because I am interested in gaining work experience before graduating college. I am applying to become assistant features editor in the upcoming year to learn more about managing a team of journalists and editing articles. The Highlanderâ€™s goal is to provide entertainment and keep its readers up to date but first and foremost, it is a way to preserve history and remember everything that has happened on the UCR campus in the past. I am grateful to be one of the people preserving our campusâ€™ history. <br><br>
        My previous work experience has mostly consisted of tutoring students and babysitting children. As a tutor, I prepared sessions for my students and provided them with fun and entertaining games to help them learn the material. I was more specifically a tutor in French and English and I helped them with homework and understanding these languagesâ€™ fundamentals. Additionally, I babysat children and helped them with their homework as well as cooked their meals, provided them with fun activities and helped them get ready for bed. <br><br>
        At my high school, I was a student ambassador and showed the school around to new parents and potential students. I talked about my experience at this high school and answered any questions that were asked. I was very involved in my school because on top of being a school ambassador, I was a member of the Student Body. I gave ideas and helped organize fundraisers and school events and dances for the students to make their time in high school as smooth and enjoyable as possible. <br><br>

        I was also a club co-leader as I created a club in which students could meet parents who would explain their job. This club was called Meet The Leaders Of Today and Tomorrow and meetings took place once every month. We have invited parents who are movie directors, ambassadors at Google, company CEOs and doctors. This provided students with the opportunity to explore future potential jobs.
